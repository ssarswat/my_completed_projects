RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release 
a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached us for help with this new project. We have been provided with the data of the movies that have been
released in the past three years. We have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

 

We are a data analyst and an SQL expert. We have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For our convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into 
four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are written in the script given below. 
We have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution.
